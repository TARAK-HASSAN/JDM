             <b><ul class="img-text" style="font-size: 30px;">Skyline GT-R: A Game Changer</ul> </b>  
             The very mention of 'GT-R' conjures visions of the modern R35 GT-R coupe. The contemporary <br> 
             lineage and basic foundations of the modern-day super-GT can be traced back to the R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R, <br> 
             a car that produced 276 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. <br> <br>
             Under the hood of the R32, the 2.6-liter twin-turbocharged RB26DETT engine served as <br>
             the powerhouse that laid the foundation for the car's remarkable achievements. Teamed with <br> 
             the revered ATTESA AWD system, this dynamic duo formed an unstoppable combination, propelling <br>
            the R32 to a staggering 29 victories in a mere four seasons of the Japan Touring Car Championship <br>
            from 1990 to 1993. The R32 remained undefeated throughout this extraordinary run. <br> <br>
            The Skyline GT-R's racing prowess went beyond Japanese borders, and in Australian Touring Cars, <br>
            it utterly dominated, leading local media to christen the R32 as Godzilla, king of the monsters. <br>
            While the Skyline may have evolved into the Infiniti Q50 and the GT-R nameplate now stands alone <br> 
            as a performance marque on its own, it was when these two combined that the world took notice.

             <b><ul class="img-text" style="font-size: 30px;">Toyota Supra: A Tuner's Dream</ul></b> 
             We could easily dedicate an entire article purely to Toyota's 90s greats; such was its stature <br>
             as a powerhouse in the JDM sports car sphere of the era. <br><br>
             Toyota had many contributions to the '90s era of JDM cars, but perhaps none is more prolific <br>
             than the fourth-generation Toyota Supra. In the 1990s, the fourth-generation Supra (the Mk4 or the A80) <br>
             was produced, featuring a 2JZ-GTE engine that became famous for its tuning potential. The Supra was celebrated <br> 
             for its sleek design, powerful turbocharged 3.0-liter engine, and remarkable agility. It became a symbol of Japanese <br> 
             sports car excellence and gained worldwide recognition, partly due to its appearances in movies and video games. <br><br>
             The Supra has become a platform that tuners adore, with the 2JZ capable of 1,000 hp on stock internals and the platform <br>
             itself being able to contain all that with relatively minor modifications. From time attack specials to drag racers, there's <br>
             no sphere of motorsport the Supra hasn't excelled in, earning it a reputation as one of the greatest JDM cars ever built.

            <b><ul class="img-text" style="font-size: 30px;">Honda NSX: Precision & Performance</ul></b>  
            While most JDM superstars of the 90s tackled mainstream rivals, Honda went after a much <br>
            bigger fish: Ferrari. Honda introduced the Honda NSX (or the Acura NSX as it was sold in the US) with a bang, <br> 
            a mid-engine supercar that went toe-to-toe with the best in the industry. It was the discussion of every <br>
            automotive conversation, especially after it was revved so hard at the Detroit Auto Show that it distracted <br>
            everyone in the adjacent Ford press conference. <br><br>
            At the heart of the NSX was a 270-hp, 3.0-liter V6 engine replete with VTEC technology (although this wasn't the original plan).<br>
            It hit 0-60 in 5.2 seconds and blasted through the 1/4 mile in 13.8 seconds, beating the Ferrari 348.<br><br>
            Honda's Ferrari slaying Formula 1 motorsports division played a significant role in developing the NSX. When a car is partly <br> 
            developed with the inputs of one Ayrton Senna (at least as a marketing exercise), it is no surprise that it was taking on the <br>
            likes of Ferrari, Porsche, Lotus, and Aston Martin and flourishing. But despite this, it still had luxuries like air conditioning,<br>
            incredible visibility, comfort, and more that made it the original everyday supercar.<br> 
            The NSX also became the first Honda to wear the famous Type R badge.

              <b><ul class="img-text" style="font-size: 30px;">Mitsubishi GTO: The Joker</ul></b>
              The Mitsubishi GTO is a prime example of an underrated yet still iconic JDM car. It played<br>
              the Joker in the 90s as an unexpected technical marvel. Sold as both the Dodge Stealth <br>
              (appropriately named) and Mitsubishi 3000GT in the USA, this coupe showcased a blend of <br>
              cutting-edge technology and formidable performance. Three official generations of the 3000GT<br>
              were available in the 90s, with a common thread between them being technological advancement.<br><br>
              Various powertrain options were available, but the VR-4 variants had the biggest kick, with <br>
              a DOHC 24-valve V6 equipped with two turbos capable of 300 hp and 308 lb-ft. These derivatives <br>
              had AWD, but also had four-wheel steering, pushing the envelope of the innovation one could find <br>
              in a mainstream sports car.<br> <br>
              From 1993, Mitsubishi offered a six-speed manual transmission, adding a layer of refinement, but <br>
              in any incarnation, the 3000GT was a performance monster and could even outsprint the Acura NSX <br>
              to 60 mph.

                <b><ul class="img-text" style="font-size: 30px;">Mazda FD RX-7: Pure Innovation</ul></b>
                While developing the Mazda FD RX-7, the Japanese automaker innovated in every way it <br>
                possibly could, using motorsports know-how to develop one of the finest sports cars <br>
                of its generation. The Wankel rotary engine itself was on the receiving end of the first <br>
                series-production use of sequential twin-turbocharging in a Japanese car. The 13B was a <br>
                two-rotor engine displacing only 1.3 liters, yet it could produce upwards of 252 hp <br>
                and 217 lb-ft of torque. This was sent to the rear axle through a five-speed manual gearbox.<br> <br>
                The innovation continued with its remarkably lightweight chassis and iconic slippery design,<br>
                and weighing in at just 2,866 lbs, it could hit 60 mph in five seconds and top out at 155 mph.<br> <br>
                The FD3S helped spur the RX-7 on to become the best-selling rotary-engined sports car of all 
                <br> time, with 811,634 sold across three generations.

             The Toyota MR2 was a compact, mid-engine sports car that achieved a cult following due to <br>
             its affordability and reliability (like most Japanese cars). The third-generation MR2 (SW20)<br>
             from the 1990s was particularly popular with its edgy styling and impressive handling. <br>
             It offered a cheap-thrill experience, making it an attractive choice for sports car enthusiasts.<br><br>
             The Toyota Celica GT-Four, also known as the All-Trac in the United States, was a high- <br>
             performance version of the Celica whose roots were firmly planted in the soil of WRC stages <br>
             around the globe. It featured a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (3S-GTE) producing as much as <br>
             252 hp in the JDM-spec ST205 variant, but even the 1989-1993 ST185 was potent with up to 222 hp on tap.

             The Integra Type R stands as a quintessential JDM legend and is widely regarded as the best-<br>
             handling front-wheel-drive car ever made. Renowned for its exceptional handling and high-revving <br>
             B-series engine, it set the bar so high that even the 2024 Acura Integra Type S is continually <br>
             compared to its nearly 30-year-old forebear. The 1.8-liter B18C engine produced 195 hp, sent to <br>
             the front axle via a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission and a helical limited-slip differential.<br><br>
             Its limited production numbers make it a prized possession for JDM car aficionados, solidifying its <br>

                <b><ul class="img-text" style="font-size: 30px;">Subaru Impreza WRX: Rally-Bred Dominance</ul></b>
                While Nissan was dominating tarred circuits, Subaru was charting its own path by introducing <br>
                the first-generation Impreza. In 1992, Subaru's first road-legal WRX (World Rally eXperimental)<br>
                models hit the streets and instantly captivated the motoring world as a real rally car for the <br>
                road, utilizing WRC-proven technology in a sports car the layman could buy. If that wasn't enough,<br>
                Subaru then decided to dial it up to 11, releasing an even more spectacular version called the WRX<br>
                STi (Subaru Tecnica International) in 1994.<br> <br>
                The STi nameplate was never actually used for the vehicles that competed in and won the World Rally<br>
                Championship but represented the pinnacle of the roadgoing models. These early models were powered<br>
                by a turbocharged flat-four from the EJ family - which was only discontinued in 2019 - in either <br>
                2.0- or 2.5-liter format (market and generation-dependent), generating north of 247 horsepower.<br><br>
                Naturally, the all-wheel drive that made Subaru a dominant force on the rally circuits was also <br>
                included on the road cars, creating affordable machines that could decimate supercars in a straight <br>
                line. These early efforts alone were enough to see the WRX and WRX STI earn a place on the list of <br>
                the finest Japanese domestic market cars ever.
